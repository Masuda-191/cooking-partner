<p class="paragraph" style="margin-left:100px; margin-right:75px;">Cooking or cookery is the art, science and craft of using heat to prepare food for consumption. Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely across the world, from grilling food over an open fire to using electric stoves, to baking in various types of ovens, reflecting unique environmental, economic, and cultural traditions and trends.
Types of cooking also depend on the skill levels and training of cooks. Cooking is done both by people in their own dwellings and by professional cooks and chefs in restaurants and other food establishments. Cooking can also occur through chemical reactions without the presence of heat, such as in ceviche, a traditional South American dish where fish is cooked with the acids in lemon or lime juice or orange juice.The Cooking Academy teaches people how to prepare and cook food from around the world in a professional, enthusiastic, creative and enjoyable way.  We are unique in our approach to cookery by putting ingredients and their beneficial health properties at the heart of everything we teach.<br>We run a wide range of publicly available classes, social events for families and groups of friends.  We also have an extensive corporate client-base for whom we provide team-building events as well as corporate entertainment & hospitality events.<br>Our recipes are straightforward to replicate at home and we always use fresh, ethically-sourced ingredients.  We work in small groups so that the personal relationship with your chef and your fellow students can add to the richness of the day, whilst ensuring that everyone receives the right amount of one-to-one tutoring and the full attention of the chef taking the class.Participants can study in a global, multicultural classroom and participate in the World Campus professional networking community where they can engage in global discussions, share ideas, cultures, best practices and gain access to valuable training information.
